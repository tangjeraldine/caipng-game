# Developing a Service Simulator Game: "Cai Png: A Sums Game"

## A Description

The Cai Png Game is a simple simulator game that can be adapted for training or entertainment purposes. Players have 30 seconds to tabulate the total bill each of the 10 orders, adding up to a total play time of 5 minutes, all the while fending off a variety of scenarios that come by to distract them from their sums. 

The objective of the game is to train mental agility, by calculating the orders as accurately as possible so that the player does not get "fired" from the stall. 

This game was designed and created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript while attending the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly. 

## Tools Used

## Background 

In my previous profession, much of my roles circled around conducting relentless briefings, trainings and staff engagement. 

In between PowerPoint slides, Kahoot quizzes and sleepy faces, I wanted to pass the knowledge and tasks on hand into a simulator, to allow staff members to gain experience in and understand the mental stresses of various aspects of ground operations within a safe virtual environment. Hence, I developed the Cai Png game.
